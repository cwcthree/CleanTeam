<h3>Rules: </h3>
<p>1) All levels have little descriptions on what is going on there. Please read them first before jumping in.<br>
    2) Each level is different, but each shows the effects of climate change. (Ex: Rising sea levels or plastic waste in our waterways).<br>
    3) Every level has a time limit. Try to score as high as you can within the time limit you are given<br>(However, you can retry as many times as you would like!)<br> 
    4) Click on any of the text in each game description to start (each game starts the moment you click so be ready!)<br>
    5) Good luck and have fun! <p>

    <div id="one"><a id = gameOne href = game1.html>Level 1: Forest Fires</div>
    <div id="fire">
    <p> You start out with a water bucket in your hand.  To put out a fire, click on it with the water bucket. The goal within the time limit is to put out as many fires as you can.
         Remember to be as fast as you can because fire spreads!
        <br><br> Forest fires are large uncontrolled wildfires that take place in the forest. Some of the fiercest fires occur in the forest because there is so much fuel (trees) to burn.</p>

    <div id="two"><a id = "gameTwo" href = game2.html>Level 2: Ocean Trash</div>
    <div id="BeachTrash">
        <p>The beach is a place where we all go to play and cool off during the summer, but a group of people have dropped plastic waste on the beach and it is making its way to the ocean. Your job is to pick up trash on the beach and put it in the barrel before it reaches the ocean.
            . <br><br> As unsightly as they are, here’s the dangerous reality of trash on the beach and elsewhere: Fishing gear causes entanglements of marine mammals and can lead to injury and death Plastic containers wear down into sand-like particles and enter the food web Polystyrene leaches endocrine-disrupting chemicals which bioamplify up the food web</p>
    </div></a>
<br>
<div id="three"><a id = "gameThree" href = game3.html>Level 3: Polar Bears</div>
  <div id="polarBears"> 
     <p>Because of the warming of the planet, large chunks of the ice in the north and south poles is melting and/or breaking! For this community of polar bears, this melting has left them on stranded on an island of ice, very far away from their home.  Help the to safety by clicking on each one and dragging them over the cold water to the land on the igloo on the left!</p>
