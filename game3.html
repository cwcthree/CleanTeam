    <h2>The Problem:</h2>
    <p>Because of global warming, much of the ice at the North and South Poles has begun to melt, which has destroyed or altered many of the places where polar bears would live.  Some polar bears can even end up stranded on small chunks of ice far away from stable land!
        As a result, polar bears have become an vulnerbale species, which means that they are not quite at risk of endangerment, but could end up at risk of endangerment soon.</p>
    <h2>Resources</h2>
